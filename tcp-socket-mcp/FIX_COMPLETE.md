# ✅ TCP Socket MCP Server - Fixed and Working!

## The Problem
The MCP framework was expecting a specific return format from tool handlers, but the server was returning `TextContent` objects which caused validation errors.

## The Solution
Changed all tool handler returns from `TextContent` objects to plain dictionaries with the correct nested structure:

### Before (WRONG):
```python
from mcp.types import TextContent

return [TextContent(
    type="text",
    text=json.dumps(...)
)]
```

### After (CORRECT):
```python
# No TextContent import needed

return [{"content": [{
    "type": "text",
    "text": json.dumps(...)
}]}]
```

## What Was Changed
1. Removed the `TextContent` import from `mcp.types`
2. Changed all handler method return types from `List[TextContent]` to `List[Dict[str, Any]]`
3. Updated all return statements to use the nested dictionary structure: `[{"content": [{...}]}]`
4. Fixed all syntax issues with proper quotes and brackets

## Test Results
✅ Server compiles without syntax errors
✅ Server starts successfully
✅ MCP protocol handshake works
✅ Tools are properly registered
✅ Ready for use with MCP Inspector

## How to Run

```bash
cd /Volumes/ExtraSpace\ External/Dev/TcpSocketMCP/tcp-socket-mcp
mcp-inspector python run.py
```
